<p><a href="http://www.flow14.com">flow14</a> is based in Kansas City and I'm constantly impressed by the quality of design and advertising work found in this town. So from time to time I'll be highlighting some of my favorite local sites.</p>
<p>There's no better place to begin than <a href="http://americancopywriter.typepad.com/">American Copywriter</a> &#8211; a blog from the fine folks at <a href="http://www.wehatesheep.com">Sullivan Higdon & Sink</a> (who just launched a new site themselves). The highlight of the site is the <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=73329639&s=143441">American Copywriter podcast</a> put on (nearly) every week by John January and Tug McTighe. They do a fantastic job covering advertising, pop culture, and so much more. Don't miss it.</p>
