<p>So I was having a conversation at work today about how creative folks always have big ideas rattling around in our heads. In some cases, we're fortunate enough to have the skills and/or time to act on those ideas.</p>
<p>It made me think of a quote I ran across the other day:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Exhilaration is that feeling you get just after a great idea hits you and just before you realise what's wrong with it." -- Anonymous</p></blockquote>
<p>It's really easy to kill any idea (good or bad) by looking for shortcomings:</p>
<blockquote><p>"This 'telephone' has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us." --Western Union internal memo, 1876.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes it's best to ignore the naysayers, overlook the obstacles, and act on your ideas. Dammit.</p>
