<p>If you've ever wondered if there's anything you <em>can't</em> find on the web, Iâ€™ll let you in a little secret&#8211;there isn't.</p>
<p>I posit, <a href="http://shop.store.yahoo.com/puppetproductions/casapuwa.html">Capâ€™n Saltyâ€™s Puppet Wash</a>. </p>
<p>I'm not sure why they need a sea captain as a mascot, and I wonder about people who are that serious about puppets, but for 9 bucks, what have you got to lose?</p>
