<p>I finally made it to the new Puma store at my local mall to grab a <a href="http://store.puma.com/pumaUSStore/product.asp?catalog%5Fname=PumaUS&category%5Fname=MensNewStuffFootwear&product%5Fid=30150901&productType=Footwear&mainCategory=Men&shopBy=style&siteid=1">fresh pair of kicks</a> and when I got them home I was pleasantly surprised to find this clever message on the bottom of my shopping bag:</p>
<p><a rel="lightbox" href="http://www.flow14.com/wordpress/wp-content/postimages/puma-sack-lg.jpg" title="Puma’s shopping bag"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/puma-sack-lg.jpg" width="450" height="249" alt="Puma’s shopping bag - click to enlarge" /></a></p>
<p>It reads:</p>
<p>"CAUTION: THIS IS NOT A TOY. Obviously, it's just a bag. OK, we didn't really think you would mistake it for a games consol. [sic] All we mean is don't fool around and put it on your head, you'll just look silly."</p>
<p>It's always fun to find little bits of unexpected humor in seemingly mundane places... kudos to the copywriter! Shame on the proofreader though... unless there's an alternate spelling for "console" that I'm not aware of.</p>
