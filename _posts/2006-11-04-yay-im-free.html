<p>Today the dream of becoming rich beyond my wildest dreams by selling a highly stylized derivative of two display fonts ends.</p>
<p>I first tried to sell this font for $19.95, to no avail. Then I marked it down $5 &mdash; no takers. So I'm giving up and giving it away. </p>
<p>There are a few strings attached: <strong>Do</strong> feel free to use this font in any private or commercial manner you see fit. <strong>Don't</strong> redistribute, sell (good luck), redesign, or otherwise re-anything this font. If you are lucky enough to use this font in a project, please send sample so I can see the wonderful things you've done with it.</p>
<p>Enough gabbing, <a href="http://www.flow14.com/fonts/">go get it.</a></p>
