<p><a href="http://niceone.org/infodesign/">Information Design Patterns</a> - a nice collection of common information design approaches; includes detailed descriptions, usage and examples.</p>
<p><a href="http://hellyeahdude.com/articles/qr-codes-are-paving-a-way-tlo-share-and-hide-media/">QR codes are paving a way to share and hide media</a> - I don't think QR codes have really caught on in the States, but I think they offer a lot of potential for unobtrusive mobile/real-world advertising.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elsonue.com/2008/03/best-atm-interface-yet.html">Best ATM Interface Yet</a> - a nice write-up of the new Wells Fargo ATM interface &#8212; with pictures!</p>
<p><a href="http://brightkite.com/">Brightkite</a> - I've been using <a href="http://brightkite.com/">brightkite</a> for a few weeks now; I'm still trying to get a handle on the possibilities it offers &#8212; I'd like to see location-enabled integration with Yelp, Upcoming and other local-centric services and advertising. I think it could really take off with GPS-enabled phones and/or automated updates. If you're looking for an invite, hit me up on <a href="http://twitter.com/flow14">twitter</a> or <a href="http://www.flow14.com/contact.html">e-mail</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of twitter, <a href="http://jonathanfields.com/blog/jetblue-twitter-customer-service-or-to-spy/">Is JetBlue using twitter to spy on its customersâ€¦or blow their minds?</a> is a good read &#8212; describing one guy's personalized big brother-type experience with a notable brand. I can envision a day when this approach becomes unmanageable for big companies (like when the lawyers get involved).  For now, it's really exciting to see this kind of interaction with customers. </p>
