<p>The next generation of Wordpress is <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">officially available</a>. Sporting a brand new dashboard designed by the folks at <a href="http://www.happycog.com/">Happy Cog</a>, a slew of <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/">new features</a> (and a new look for <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a>); it looks like a winner.</p>
