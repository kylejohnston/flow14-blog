<p>More notes from day 1 of Where 2.0 &#8211; the day's over and there's a lot to take in.</p>
<p>The other big Google announcement was Google Mapplets. The best way to describe Mapplets is to use Google's words: "mashup of mashups".  Meaning you can take a services built on Google Maps (choose from 1000's) and combine them for (what's likely to be) some really interesting results. There's more in-depth detail over at the <a href="http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2007/05/mashup-of-mashups.html">Google Lat Long Blog</a>.</p>
<p>Garmin (my travel companions) announced our <a href="http://developer.garmin.com">developer site</a> with a focus on <a href="http://developer.garmin.com/web-device/garmin-communicator-plugin/">Garmin Communicator</a> &#8211; a browser plugin that allows websites like <a href="http://www.geocaching.com">Geocaching.com</a> and <a href="http://www.motionbased.com">MotionBased</a> to send and receive GPS data to Garmin devices. <a href="http://developer.garmin.com/web-products/">Web Services</a> is another tool that opens up the power of MotionBased's data and tools. Last but not least, <a href="http://developer.garmin.com/web-device/garmin-communicator-plugin/devicecontrol/web-drop/">Web Drop</a> is (I think) a little hidden gem that allows you to highlight any address on the web, geocode it and send it to a Garmin device with a single click.</p>
<p>That's all I'm writing for today; I need to cull through my notes before I write about all the other stuff that was announced or discussed today.</p>
