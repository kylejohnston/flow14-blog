<p>Lots of good stuff out on the ol' interwebs this week. In no particular order:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.orangeunderground.com/">The Orange Underground</a> - an interesting campaign for Cheetos by Goodby Silverstein. There are a lot of nice little touches, like the pattern overlaying the video and the cheap "paper" and felt-tip pen drawings in the cookbook.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/01/15/super-sweet-16-meets-survivor/">Exiled!</a>, a new show from MTV. Take the Super Sweet 16 kids and send them to live with tribes in Africa and Antartica. It sounds like a joke, but the <a href="http://fallontrendpoint.blogspot.com/2008/01/de-blinging-of-mtv.html">Fallon Planning Blog</a> has the skinny.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFkepEu2e6w">Guinness, Life of a Dot</a>, a nice progression of their award-winning <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t4sdgvy-pk">Evolution</a> spot. I think these pieces complement each other nicely without trying to rehash the exact same idea.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cpbgroup.com/thanksomatic/">CP+B's Holiday Card</a> - made for a select group of their clients, this card features a nice little customizable video and some surprising interaction at the end. (Use this code: 547WERT)</p>
<p>More on the CP+B tip, they're doing some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtRx0ja7WMQ">nice work</a> for Domino's now; taking them back to their "30 minutes or it's free" guarantee.</p>
<p>Cool Flash-based website for <a href="http://www.soiakyo.com/">So√Øa & Kyo</a>, a fashion outerwear maker. Love the 3D space mixed with the hand-drawn elements.</p>
