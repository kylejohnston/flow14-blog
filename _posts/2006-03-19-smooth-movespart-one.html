<p><strong>How to create seamless, non-linear transitions in Flash</strong></p>
<p>This tutorial demonstrates how to smoothly transition between external SWFs. This is similar to a method described at <a href="http://www.kirupa.com/developer/mx2004/transitions.htm">Kirupa</a>, but it's a bit simpler.</p>
