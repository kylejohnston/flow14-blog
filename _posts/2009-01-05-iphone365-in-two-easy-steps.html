<p> The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/iphone365/">iPhone365</a> group formed on January 1st, but it's never too late to start participating.</p>
<p>The rules are simple:</p>
<p>1. Possess an iPhone</p>
<p>2. Take a picture a day, every day, for a year</p>
<p>Neither of these steps are necessarily easy, but if you've accomplished step one, there's no excuse for not at least <em>attempting</em> step two.</p>
<p>And, if there isn't an iPhone in your future, you can still participate in a 365 project&#8212;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/groups/?w=all&q=365&m=names">there are gobs of groups to choose from over at Flickr.</a></p>
<p><small>*note that step two could actually be considered 365 steps, but I like to keep it <strike>real</strike> simple.</small></p>
