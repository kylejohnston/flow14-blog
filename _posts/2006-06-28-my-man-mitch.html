<p>I've been a big fan of <a title="Wikipedia: Mitch Hedberg, R.I.P." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Hedberg">Mitch Hedberg</a> for many years. I've been a big fan of <a title="World's Greatest Gourmet Sandwiches" href="http://www.jimmyjohns.com/">Jimmy John's</a> for many years. So I was pleasantly surprised to hear Mitch's familiar voice come over the speakers while browsing Jimmy's site in a recent creative meeting. It may just be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consensus_effect">false consensus effect</a>, but I think Mitch is &#8211; er, was &#8211; a spot-on match for JJ's clientele.</p>
<p>I'm not sure who's responsible for the radio, but I know Wisconsin's own <a href="http://www.planetpropaganda.com/">Planet Propaganda</a> has some hand in JJ's brand.</p>
<p>Thanks to an entertaining-yet-unlinkable flash site, I can't send you directly to the spots. But if you have some time to surf <a href="http://www.jimmyjohns.com/">Jimmy John's dot com</a>, look for "Fun" and you'll find the ad archives, full of Mitchy goodness.</p>
