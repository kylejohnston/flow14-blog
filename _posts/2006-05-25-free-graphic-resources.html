<p>In a spirit of giving inspired by <a href="http://www.designbum.net/downloads.htm">DesignBum</a>, I've decided to offer some of the graphic resources that I've found handy over the years. Over the next week or so (at least until I run out of stuff to give away), you can look forward to free downloads of Illustrator files, images, and textures.</p>
<div class="postImage"><a href="http://www.flow14.com/files/mobilephone-generic.zip" title="Generic Mobile Phone Artwork - Zipped .AI file" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/files/phone');"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/cellphone.gif" width="150" height="205" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>I'll set it off with a <a href="http://www.flow14.com/files/mobilephone-generic.zip" title="Generic Mobile Phone Artwork - Zipped .AI file" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/files/phone');">generic mobile phone</a> I recently created in Illustrator. This is loosely based on the ubiquitous RAZR, and it's great for mockups, demos, etc.</p>
<p>My only request of those who <a href="http://www.flow14.com/files/mobilephone-generic.zip" title="Generic Mobile Phone Artwork - Zipped .AI file" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/files/phone');">download this artwork</a>: if you use this in any your projects, send me a screenshot, URL, or printed sample.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
