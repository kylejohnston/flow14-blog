<p>I'm happy to announce that I'm a presenter at the first annual <a href="http://www.kcdesignweek.org/">Kansas City Design Week</a> on Thursday, February, 4.</p>
<p>I'll be presenting with couple of other guys from <a href="http://www.garmin.com">work</a>; we'll be talking about the impact of design on business and how a the perception of a brand is shaped by the design of products, user experience and messaging. We've had a few calls with the organizers of design week and quite a bit of brainstorming amongst ourselves. After a breakthrough today, it feels like the presentation is finally starting to come together... excitement is building.</p>

<p>KC Design week is all about celebrating the value of design, including graphic design, industrial design and architecture. There are a bunch of cool design-related events throughout the week (all of which are free), so head over to <a href="http://www.kcdesignweek.org/">KCDesignWeek.org</a> to check out the schedule and reserve a space for yourself. From what I've heard, about 90 people have registered for our session, which means we're *this close* to a sold-out show.</p>
<p>And if your at the AIA building on the 4th, stop by and say 'hi!'.
