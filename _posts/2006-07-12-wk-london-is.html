<p>...blogging and <strike>podcasting</strike>. Apparently they've been at it for a while now. It's an interesting and fairly candid look inside part a big olâ€™ multinational ad agency. Check it out here: <a href="http://wklondon.typepad.com/">Optimism</a></p>
<p>I was going to review their podcast, but it's a 40MB+ mixtape with peculiar audio samples sprinkled throughout. I can't recommend waiting for the download.</p>
<p>Guess I'll be sticking with the consistently capricious <a href="http://americancopywriter.typepad.com/">American Copywriter</a> podcast.</p>
<p>As for me, today I have the pleasure of being stuck in <a href="http://americancopywriter.typepad.com/">Richmond International Airport</a>. Oh well, at least they have free WiFi.</p>
