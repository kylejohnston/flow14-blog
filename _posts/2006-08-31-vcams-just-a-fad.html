<p><a href="http://www.current.tv/">Current</a> has been running <a href="http://www.current.tv/make/vc2/vcam">viewer-created ad messages</a> (VCAMs) for a while now. 99% of the ads prove the being consistently clever and creative while delivering a compelling, coherent brand message isn't as easy as it looks.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: Current lines up a sponsor; the first was Sony, followed by Toyota and L'Oreal. The sponsor provides assets (primarily photos and logos) and a creative brief; a little background on the brand, the feeling they want the ads to evoke, etc.</p>
<p>Next, Current viewers download the assets, ignore the brief, and set to work on their commercials. The results generally look like local commercials for global brands, with a few notable exceptions:</p>

<p><em>This example was created by an <a href="http://www.makevisual.com/">animation and visual effects studio</a></em></p>
<p>However, even the quality submissions don't do a great job of representing these big-name brands. It will be interesting to see if consumer-generated advertising is a passing fad or if consumers and companies can mature the process and create truly compelling work.</p>
