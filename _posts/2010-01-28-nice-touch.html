<p>Nice touch in the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/gallery/">iPad Gallery</a> — the 360° is just a series of JPEGs and the ‘spinning’ is handled via JavaScript… which means it works in mobile Safari. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/blue_boxes">No Flash</a>. No Quicktime. It just works. It feels like Flash is losing more and more ground every day.</p>
