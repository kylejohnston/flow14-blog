<p>CS3 is live on Adobe's site today: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/creativelicense/">Creative License</a>.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/web/customers/">Web Premium suite</a> to see <a href="http://www.urbanphotosafari.com">Dean</a>, <a href="http://www.topcitywebdesign.com">Marcus</a>, and I talk about how Adobe makes our lives easier.</p>
<p>Seriously, we've been beta testing Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, and Dreamweaver since late January &mdash; they're all a big improvement over CS2.</p>
