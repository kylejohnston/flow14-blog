<p>So in a <a href="http://www.flow14.com/blog/?p=22">previous post</a>, I <strike>suckered</strike> scored readers with a <strike>mislead</strike> compelling headline. Little did I know, there's a name for that &#8211; an <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/how-to-write-headlines-that-work/">indirect headline</a>. I stumbled across this tidbit on <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com">copyblogger</a>, a great site about writing for the wild, wild web.</p>
<p>In fact, there's a whole series, <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/copywriting-101/">Copywriting 101</a>, that's loaded with great tips for bloggers, marketers, and anyone else who writes for the web.</p>
