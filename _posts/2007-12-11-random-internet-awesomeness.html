I suspect this kind of thing abounds  on Amazon if you're willing to look for it.

<p>The creative cats at <a href="www.barkleyus.com">Barkley</a> have opened the <a href="http://badgiftemporium.com/">Bad Gift Emporium</a> &#8212; a place to show off the thoughtful-yet-awful gifts that should have never been given. Best of all, you can post your own examples of Christmas crap and work out trades so you can get your hands on someone else's crap (if that's your thing).</p>
