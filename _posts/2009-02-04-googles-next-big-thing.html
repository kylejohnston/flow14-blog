<p><strong>One word: stickers.</strong></p>
<p>Scanning through my Gmail today, I noticed a bright red link at the top of the page reading, "Do more with labels!" I clicked through and landed on <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/about_whatsnew.html">Google's What's New page</a>, where I spied a unicorn posing in front of a rainbow.</p>
<p><a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/get-your-gmail-stickers.html"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-618" title="Gmail Stickers" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/gmail_stickers.jpg" alt="Gmail Stickers" width="630" height="210" /></a></p>
<p>I thought maybe they were getting on the <a href="http://www.cornify.com/">cornify</a> bandwagon <em>(hat tip to <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/11668738747318254104">Ryan</a>)</em>, but the modest use of glitter led me to dig a little deeper and learn that <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/get-your-gmail-stickers.html">Google is indeed giving away stickers</a> for the low, low price of a self-addressed stamped envelope.</p>
<p>And now that Google's released <a href="http://www.google.com/latitude/intro.html">Latitude</a>, you know exactly where you can find friends to swap stickers. Integration, people. Integration.</p>
