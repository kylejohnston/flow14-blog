<p>The regular reader of this blog may notice a slight change in the design. That's due to the new design, dubbed 'monsterism', which debuted today. I've had this idea swimming around in my head since February, and thanks to a recent holiday and vacation day, I finally had time to put my ideas to pixels.</p>
<p>Feed subscribers should be none the wiser, but you might want to drop by the site to keep yourself in the know.</p>
<p>I know there's a bug or two to work on, but let me know if you see anything really odd.</p>
<p>Now back to my regular intermittent blogging schedule.</p>
