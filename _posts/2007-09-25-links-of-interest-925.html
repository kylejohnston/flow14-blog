<p><a href="http://eeblet.com/index.php/2007/09/09/semantic-markup-so-what/">Semantic markup. So what?</a> - this is the clearest case for semantic markup I've seen in a while. The gist is, write your HTML to reflect the structure of your content. Let's say your page is viewed without stylesheets (i.e. a mobile browser). It should be just as clear and user-friendly in that environment as it would be in any modern browser. Easy peasy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2007/07/28/social-network-exhaustion-or-facebook-bankruptcy-redux/">Social Network Exhaustion</a> - asks the question, what's the point of social networking social if you're not socializing? Maybe networking, socially is a better moniker.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thenewatlantis.com/archive/17/rosen.htm">Virtual friendship and the New Narcissim</a> - aka more Facebook navel-gazing. It's a long term paper-ish read &mdash; if you've ever seen or used a social networking site, you can skip the first half &mdash; but the article raises some interesting points.</p>
