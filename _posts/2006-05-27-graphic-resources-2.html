<p>In a spirit of giving inspired by <a href="http://www.designbum.net/downloads.htm">DesignBum</a>, I've decided to offer some of the graphic resources that I've found handy over the years. Over the next week or so (at least until I run out of stuff to give away), you can look forward to free downloads of Illustrator files, images, and textures.</p>
<p>Part two is a <a href="http://www.flow14.com/files/badge-scallop.zip" title="Scalloped Badge Artwork - Zipped .AI file" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/files/badge');">badge</a>. But it's not just a simple starburst-style badge, this one has scalloped edges, and those aren't easy to make. I used <a href="http://www.bartelme.at/journal/267/">Bartleme's</a> Photoshop tutorial as a starting point and recreated this bad boy with Illustrator's vectory goodness.</p>
<p>My only request of those who <a href="http://www.flow14.com/files/badge-scallop.zip" title="Scalloped Badge Artwork - Zipped .AI file" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/files/badge');">download this artwork</a>: if you use this in any your projects, send me a screenshot, URL, or printed sample.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
