<p>In a spirit of giving inspired by DesignBum, I've decided to offer some of the graphic resources that I've found handy over the years. This post marks the fourth entry in a <a href="http://www.flow14.com/blog/category/freebies/">four part series</a></p>
<p>Some call it the <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/archives/000024.html">wicked worn look</a>. Others call it <a href="http://misterretro.com/image_filters.html">machine washed</a>. In the circles I run in, it's called the distressed look. Each of these four patterns are actually 1-bit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_Image_File_Format">TIFF</a> files. Each file can easily be imported into Illustrator or opened in Photoshop and colorized to your liking. Just lay your favorite pattern on top of your existing design, set it to match the background color, and you're like two seconds from taking your designs from a'ight to tight.</p>
<p>My only request of those who <a href="http://www.flow14.com/files/distressed.zip" title="Distressed patterns - Zipped .AI file" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/files/distressed');">download</a> this artwork: if you use this in any your projects, send me a screenshot, URL, or printed sample.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
