<p>Very cool <a href="http://www.designrelated.com/news/feature_view?id=47">campaign for Chiquita</a> — makes fantastic use of their abundant free “media”. I really like this because it's an idea that's been there (probably) for as long as the brand's been around, and all it took was a little creative thinking to give the brand some great personality.</p>
