<p>Starting back in 2009, I've participated in a photo-a-day project called <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/iphone365">iPhone 365</a>. At the end of every year, I've created a video/slideshow to showcase all of my photos. This year, I managed to capture 365 photos (my 3rd consecutive year).</p>

<p>This year, I mixed in bits of video amongst the photos – I think it adds a nice feel to the piece, and it's something I hope to do more in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Production Notes</strong></p>
<p>All photos &amp; video were shot with an iPhone 5</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apps - Shooting:</strong> Camera (default), <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slow-shutter-cam/id357404131?mt=8">SlowShutter</a> (long exposures), <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snappycam-pro-fast-camera/id463688713?mt=8">SnappyCam</a> (for action)</li>
<li><strong>Apps - Editing:</strong> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vsco-cam/id588013838?mt=8">VSCOcam</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camera+/id329670577?mt=8">Camera+</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/image-blender/id414544492?mt=8">Image Blender</a></li>
<li><strong>365 Video:</strong> Downloaded photos from my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/flow14/sets/72157632410070343/">2013 365 Flickr set</a> using <a href="http://www.malarkeysoftware.com/projects_PhotoGrabbr.html">Photo Grabbr</a> then compiled and edited everything with Adobe Premiere. In years past, I compiled the video using Apple iMovie; taking a bit of time to learn how to use Premiere was a <em>huge</em> step forward – it provides a lot more control over the timing of each photo and I'm much happier with the quality of the finished piece.</li>
</ul>
