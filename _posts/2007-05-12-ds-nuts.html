<p>I was reading a little about Delta's new logo today and  I happened across the Delta Museum's <a href="http://www.deltamuseum.org/M_Education_DeltaHistory_Facts_Logos.htm">logo timeline</a> and found this explanation of their newest mark:</p>
<p><img id="image93" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/delta.jpg" width="540" height="79" alt="delta's blowing smoke" /></p>
<p><small><em>logo by <a href="http://www.lippincottmercer.com/home.php">Lippincott</a></em></small></p>
<p>Now, I like the new look, but that whole statement is nuts. I may buy wine based on the label, but a logo by itself is going to convince me that any company is "highly differentiated" and "customer-focused" &mdash; especially when I've been a disappointed customer. Delayed flights, indifferent employees, unusually cramped seats, old planes... these are the areas to fix and differentiate yourself to prove you've changed. </p>
<p>They've created a nice <a href="http://change.delta.com">website</a> to show they're trying, but it's going to be difficult to shake their crummy reputation.</p>
<p>There's more great discussion about the logo itself over at Speak Up's <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/delta_dealt_a_good_hand.php">Brand New</a>.</p>
