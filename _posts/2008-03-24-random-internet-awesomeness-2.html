<p>I'm fine-tuning my remaining <a href="14.com/blog/2008/03/17/sxswi-recap-day-one/">SXSWi wrap-up posts</a> (I'm planning to post them later this week).</p>
<p>In the meantime, enjoy the random internet awesomeness that's caught my attention as of late:</p>
<p>The <a href="http://960.gs/">960 Grid System</a>; similar to my favorite CSS framework, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/">Blueprint CSS</a>. I haven't tried it yet, so I can't say how it's any better or worse.</p>
<p>A while back, Microsoft signed up with CP+B to the tune of $300 million; it seems the fruits of CP+B's creative efforts are <a href="http://cajunboyinthecity.blogspot.com/2008/03/microsoft-apparently-hopes-that-jackass.html">beginning to bloom</a>. Part warm-and-fuzzy, part jackass (although not necessarily at the same time.)</p>
<p>Noted for (mostly for my) future CSS reference: <a href="http://www.css3.info/a-brief-introduction-to-opacity-and-rgba/">using Opacity vs RGBA</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.southparkstudios.com/">Every episode</a> of South Park, ever. Nice. Similar to <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml">The Daily Show's</a> extensive archive.</p>
<p><a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/03/21/squirrel-social-network.html">Squirrels network like Facebook friends</a> - not that they've mastered computers or anything, but it's probably just a matter of time.</p>
