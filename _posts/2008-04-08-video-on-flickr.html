<p><a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en/2008/04/08/video-on-flickr/">Video on Flickr? </a> <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en/2008/04/09/video-on-flickr-2/">Video on Flickr! </a> It's live, but there are some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/video/">limitations</a> (90 seconds &#8212; really?). It doesn't beat <a href="http://www.vimeo.com">Vimeo</a> (my benchmark for online video), but this is a long time coming and it's a step in the right direction.</p>
