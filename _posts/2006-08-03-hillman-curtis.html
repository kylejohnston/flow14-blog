<p>A great interview with James Victore; part of <a href="http://www.hillmancurtis.com/">Hillman Curtis'</a> <a href="http://www.hillmancurtis.com/hc_web/film_video.shtml">Artist Series</a> (which includes my favorite interview with <a href="http://www.hillmancurtis.com/hc_web/film_video/source/milton.php">Milton Glaser</a>).</p>
<p>The connection that I find most interesting in this series (the ones I've watched, anyway), is that most the designers & artists shy away from using computers for any part of their process &#8211; something that would terrify many contemporary designers.</p>
