<p>There's a new soon-to-be-overused web design technique making its way across the internets. I don't know if it has a name yet, so I'll dub it... subtle suede. <em>(Sandpaper would have worked too, but it doesn't sound as sexy.)</em> I first used it on a <a href="http://developer.garmin.com">work project</a>, then <a href="http://www.flow14.com/blog/">this blog</a>, but I think the technique received its widest acclaim thanks to <a href="http://www.blueflavor.com/">Blue Flavor's</a> tasty <a href="http://getleaflets.com">Leaflets</a> site.</p>
<p>It super easy to create... all you need is Photoshop and a few minutes to kill. Here's the how-to: <!--more--></p>
<p>1. Create your canvas. This texture repeats fairly seamlessly, so size doesn't matter. I've selected 100x100 to make things easy to see here.</p>

<p>2. Fill your background layer with your favorite color.</p>

<p>3. Add a new layer and fill that with any ol' color.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/step03.jpg" alt="subtle-suede-step03" /></p>
<p>4. With your new layer highlighted, make some noise. Go to Filter &gt; Noise &gt; Add Noise...</p>

<p>5. Leave Monochromatic checked, then tweak the Amount and Distribution values to your liking. My favorite values are picture here.</p>

<p>6. Time to make it subtle... set your blend mode to Soft Light and crank the opacity way down. I usually set mine to 8% â€” anything over 15% and the subtlety is lost.</p>

<p>7. Done. If you're using this for a background, add it to your stylesheet and repeat appropriately. See the finished result <a href="http://www.flow14.com/examples/subtle-suede.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.flow14.com/examples/suede-gradient.html">here</a>.</p>
