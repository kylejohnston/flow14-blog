<p><a href="http://www.email-standards.org">Email Standards Project</a> launched today. It's all about bringing web standards support to e-mail clients by educating web designers and developers and a starting a dialogue with email client developers.</p>
<p>The current state of web standards support in email can best be described as dismal. It's a throwback to the early days of the web with each client (both desktop and online) offering wildly varied levels of support for basic HTML and CSS. You can <a href="http://www.email-standards.org/clients/">see the results</a> of ESP's client tests <a href="http://www.email-standards.org/clients/">here</a>. </p>
<p>It's a grassroots movement spearheaded by the fine folks at <a href="http://www.freshview.com/">Freshview</a>, makers of <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/">Campaign Monitor</a>, some of the easiest to use email newsletter software around.</p>
<p>Find out <a href="http://www.email-standards.org/what-you-can-do/">what you can do to help</a> and <a href="http://www.email-standards.org/blog/">follow the latest developments</a> on the <a href="http://www.email-standards.org/blog/">ESP blog</a>.</p>
