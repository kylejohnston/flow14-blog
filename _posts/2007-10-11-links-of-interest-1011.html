<p>The Sony Bravia spot you haven't seen (probably) - <a href="http://adsoftheworld.com/media/tv/sony_bravia_pyramid">watch it</a>. Made for Egypt <em>after</em> balls, paint and bunnies.</p>
<p>A couple of nice recent examples of motion design: <a href="http://cobracreative.com/portfolioExtras/ClifBar/">Clif Bar 2 Mile Challenge</a> (bonus: it's a great idea) and <a href="http://www.artois.co.uk/">Stella Artois</a>. Both throwbacks to the <a href="http://www.mk12.com/v5_quicktime/2003/brazil.mov">progenitors of the style,</a> <a href="http://www.mk12.com">MK12</a></p>
