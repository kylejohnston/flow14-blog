<p>Looking at the title of this video, I thought I had a pretty good idea of what I was in for.</p>
<p>I was wrong... so so wrong.</p>
<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/8VrCCpaEoxI" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/8VrCCpaEoxI" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>
<p>If you're brave enough to associate yourself with the video (and fight the good fight for net neutrality), you can nerd it up with your very own <a href="http://www.wearetheweb.org/">cotton billboard</a>.</p>
