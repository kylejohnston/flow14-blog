<p>This is a pretty incredible microsite for <a href="http://www.cokezerogame.com/">Coke Zero</a> built by the gang at <a href="http://www.northkingdom.com/">North Kingdom</a>. It's a really smooth integration of rich streaming video combined with basic controls that add up to a surprisingly playable set of games.</p>
<p>If you can pull yourself away from <a href="http://www.cokezerogame.com/">the games</a>, North Kingdom has posted a nice <a href="http://demo.northkingdom.com/cokezerogame/">behind the scenes</a> look at the production.</p>
<p>It's very reminiscent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_lair">Dragon's Lair</a> &mdash; if Dragon's Lair actually worked. It only took 25 years to get it right.</p>
