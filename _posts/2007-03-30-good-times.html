<p>I had a busy morning today, starting with my first appearance at <a href="http://americancopywriter.typepad.com/blog/2007/03/coffee_morning_.html">KC Coffee Morning</a> &mdash; hopefully not my last. It was fun to meet the people behind the blogs and listen to creatives crack jokes.</p>
<p>Once I was sufficiently caffeinated with a <a href="http://www.jpwinebar.com/">JP's</a> dark roast, I buzzed over to the <a href="http://www.kcai.edu">Kansas City Art Institute</a> where <a href="http://www.designtribune.com">Dean</a> and I gave a little presentation to <a href="http://thenewprogramme.net/">Tyler's</a> Senior <a href="http://www.kcai.edu/majors/graphicdesign/">Graphic Design</a> class. I hope everyone enjoyed the presentation &mdash; the students were really engaged and asked some great questions.</p>
<p>As promised, I'll post a few of my favorite links and I'll work on a follow-up post with advice for the soon-to-be job seekers...</p>
