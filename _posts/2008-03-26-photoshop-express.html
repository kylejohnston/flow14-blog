<p>Adobe just released <a href="https://www.photoshop.com/express/"><strong>Photoshop Express</strong></a>, their online Flash-based version of Photoshop (think <a href="http://www.picnik.com/">Picnik</a>). 2GB of free storage, galleries and photo editing (including color correction, red eye removal, effects and more). After a quick <a href="https://www.photoshop.com/express/index.html?bypass&wf=testdrive">test drive</a>, I'm impressed.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Sidebar: also pleasantly surprised they're offering a test drive without the need to create an account&#8212;a la <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/signupforms">sign up forms must die</a>.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I'm curious to see how this will evolve, specifically integration with other sites&#8212;they call out blogs and Facebook, but the ability to integrate with Flickr and other photo sharing sites (via API or otherwise) would be a nice touch.</p>
