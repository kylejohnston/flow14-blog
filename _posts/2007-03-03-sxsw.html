<p><a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/">SXSW Interactive</a> is  drawing near. <a href="http://www.urbanphotosafari.com">Dean</a> and I will southbound on the 9th representing the <a href="http://garmin.blogs.com">Big G</a>. My calendar is double and triple booked &mdash; too many interesting panels (and parties) to choose from. I'm really looking forward to meeting a lot of talented people, getting rid of all of my <a href="http://www.moo.com">moo cards</a>, and scouting for talent. We have quite a few web spots open at <a href="http://www.garmin.com">work</a>, so if you're looking for a job in Sausalito CA or Olathe KS, track me down.</p>
<p>In other news, <a href="http://www.urbanphotosafari.com">Dean</a>, <a href="http://www.topcitywebdesign">Marcus</a> and I met some nice folks from Adobe and <a href="http://www.studiobfilms.com/">Studio B Films</a> last week, and there's tons of video to prove it. Here's the story: I handed a business card to an Adobe PR rep at Macworld 2006. Fast forward a year, and I get a CS3 beta invite followed by an invite to appear in an Adobe video talking about how they help us GTD. I figured they would show up with a couple of people and a hand held camera. Wrong. A whole crew with a truck full of lights and cameras and a full day of shooting. Crazy. We'll see how it turned out later this month.</p>
