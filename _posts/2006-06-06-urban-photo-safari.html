<p>If you own a digital camera, live anywhere near Kansas City, and have a little free time this weekend, be sure to check out the 4th annual <a href="http://www.urbanphotosafari.com">Urban Photo Safari</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.urbanphotosafari.com/contest.html">You can find all of the important details here</a>, but here's the elevator pitch for the impatient: you're given four hours and a geographic boundary to shoot as many pics as your memory card can hold. Your 10 favorite pics are posted on the <a href="http://www.urbanphotosafari.com">Urban Photo Safari website</a>. Once everyone's photos are posted, you look them over and vote for the 10 best. The photo that gets the most votes wins.</p>
<p>I've done it twice now and I'm hooked. It's a great way to stretch your creative muscles, meet some cool people and see a lot of great photos.</p>
