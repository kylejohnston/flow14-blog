<p>Really interesting article from the Atlantic &#8212; <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/google/">Is Google Making Us Stupid?</a> The gist is that with such easy access to near-limitless amounts of information, we let machines supplant thinking and our attention span and memory retention suffers accordingly. I think the historical examples found at the end of the article  are an interesting counterpoint to the premise &#8212; be wary of change because Bad Things will surely occur. However, in every example, the changes &#8212; paper, printing press, internet &#8212; brought much more positive change than negative. Perhaps we're in the thick of a similar cycle &#8212; our brains just need to catch up with our ambition.</p>
