<p>I'm happy to announce the launch of a new site: <a href="http://www.creative-cohort.com">creative-cohort.com</a>. Creative Cohort started life as a <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1128217&amp;trk=hb_side_g">LinkedIn Group</a>. The group quickly attracted a lot of smart folks who sparked a lot of great discussions and it didn't seem fair to keep those discussions confined to the closed walls of LinkedIn, so <a href="http://www.creative-cohort.com">Creative Cohort</a> was born.</p>
<p>All the articles are written by creative directors with the goal of helping fellow CDs and aspiring CDs grow and learn more about the in and outs of the biz. <a href="http://www.creative-cohort.com/authors/">Seven other creative directors</a> with a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences have volunteered to contribute to the site (and I'm always looking for more contributors). Be sure to check it out and bookmark it or add it to your favorite feedreader. That name again? <a href="http://www.creative-cohort.com">Creative Cohort</a>.</p>
<p>And thanks to <a href="http://www.ilopezyou.com/">Sebastian Lopez</a> for supplying the cool illustration.</p>
