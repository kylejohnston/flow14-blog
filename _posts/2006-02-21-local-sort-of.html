<p>So I'm reading <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/">Speak Up</a>, one of the best design forums around, when I run across a site called <a href="http://www.sixdegreeszine.com/">Six&deg;</a>, a zine created by a group of <a href="http://ncsudesign.org/content/">North Carolina State</a> design students. I click on the current multimedia issue, and I see a familiar name: <a href="http://www.thenewprogramme.net/frameset.html">Tyler Galloway</a>, a former KC resident.</p>
<p>Tyler is currently completing his Master's Degree at NC State, with plans return to KC and teach at the <a href="http://www.kcai.edu/">Kansas City Art Insitute</a>.</p>
<p>It's a small, small world.</p>
