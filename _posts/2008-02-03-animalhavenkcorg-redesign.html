<p><a href="http://www.flow14.com/wordpress/wp-content/postimages/home_page-sm.jpg" title="Redesigned Animal Haven homepage" rel="lightbox"><img class="postImage" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/home_page-sm.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Redesigned Animal Haven homepage" /></a>I am happy to announce the recent launch of a new website for <a href="http://www.animalhavenkc.org">Animal Haven</a>, a fantastic Kansas City-area animal shelter. Animal Haven's mission is to provide a higher quality of life for homeless pets through adoption, education and collaboration with the animal welfare community. They've been around since 1968, working hard to place homeless pets in good homes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flow14.com/wordpress/wp-content/postimages/old_homepage.jpg" title="Old Animal Haven homepage" rel="lightbox"><img class="postImage" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/old_homepage.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Old Animal Haven homepage" /></a> A friend of mine connected me with the staff at Animal Haven a few months ago. At the time, they had a website that was hard to maintain, difficult to navigate and not focused on their goal: adoptions. After talking with the staff and learning where they wanted to take the organization and the website, I was able to design a site that better addressed their audience and their mission.</p>
<p>The homepage was revamped to prominently feature adoptions; random photos of their adoptable pets (courtesy of <a href="http://www.petfinder.com">PetFinder.com</a>) are immediately visible, and visitors can view all of Animal Haven's <a href="http://www.animalhavenkc.org/adoptions/view_adoptable_pets/">adoptable pets</a> without leaving the site. I integrated tools they were already using, like Google Calendar for <a href="http://www.animalhavenkc.org/blog/calendar_of_events/">events</a> and Google Checkout for donations. Thanks to the new content management system, they can easily manage the site and incorporate content from <a href="http://www.animalhavenkc.org/about_us/">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://www.animalhavenkc.org/ways_to_help/volunteer/">PhotoBucket</a>. Last but not least, I added a <a href="http://www.animalhavenkc.org/blog/">blog</a> to help them share their success stories, shelter news, event information and more.</p>
<p>I'm really happy with the results; special thanks to the staff at Animal Haven for all of their input and effort. If you're in the Kansas City area and you'd like to adopt a pet, <a href="http://www.animalhavenkc.org">AnimalHavenKC.org</a> is the place to go.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<p>Since launching the site two weeks ago, overall visits have increased 38.5%. Pageviews have increased 180%. The bounce rate has dropped over 72% &mdash; from 66% to 18%,  the average time spent on the site has increased 144%, and blog subscriptions have been increasing every day.</p>
