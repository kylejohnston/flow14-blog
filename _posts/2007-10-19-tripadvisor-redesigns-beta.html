<p><a href="http://beta.tripadvisor.com/">TripAdvisor</a>, the travel site that has never let me down, has cracked the lid on their new site &mdash; <a href="http://beta.tripadvisor.com/">see it here</a>. Overall, it's a huge improvement â€” the effort and planning involved are evident in the information design and user experience. It's much easier on the eyes thanks to the wider layout, increased whitespace, rounded corners and more. Congrats to the design team, whoever you are. </p>
