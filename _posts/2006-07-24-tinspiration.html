<p><a title="Fossil" href="http://www.fossil.com">Fossil</a> is running a <a href="http://design.fossil.com">tin design contest</a>. Top prize is $1,000 bucks, a tin featuring your design (duh), and best of all (IMHO), a trip to their design studio in Dallas.</p>
<p>They started the contest in June and it looks like they have a paucity of entries (and even fewer quality submissions). So you have until September 12 to get your design on and have good odds on some good loot.</p>
