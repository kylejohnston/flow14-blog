<p>For those who hang on my every sporadic word via a feed reader, you may want to take some time to peruse the <a href="http://www.flow14.com">new site</a>. I've put a fresh coat of shellac on the little bugger, with special attention paid to the popular <a href="http://www.flow14.com/fonts/">fonts</a> and <a href="http://www.flow14.com/portfolio/">portfolio</a> pages.</p>
<p>My goal was to push the boundaries of traditional web layout and apply a magazine-style grid to bits of the site, which was relatively easy to achieve with the help of the handy <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/">Blueprint CSS framework</a>. I'm especially happy with the outcome of the <a href="http://www.flow14.com/portfolio/96kx/">96KX</a> and <a href="http://www.flow14.com/portfolio/ibgreek/">IBGreek</a> pages. As time allows, I hope to push the blog format in this direction, too (&agrave; la <a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/">JSM</a>). </p>

<p>Never to be outdone, <a href="http://www.ideo.com">IDEO</a> beat me to the punch by about a week with the launch of <a href="http://www.ideo.com">their new site</a>.</p>
<p>They've done an superb job of bringing a massive amount of fascinating content to the foreground while maintaing an easy-to-use, eminently browsable interface. Inspiring all around. </p>
<p>*regarding the title of the post, totally kidding.</p>
