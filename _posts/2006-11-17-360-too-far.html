<p>It seems that Burger King is growing into more of a media company than a fast food joint. Not content with stopping at <a href="http://adweek.blogs.com/adfreak/2006/07/crispin_working.html">Hollywood blockbusters</a>, BK has followed the path of trendsetters like Kool-Aid and Domino's by selling King-branded games for XBOX. Not unlike the food, they look mediocre and they're priced to match. I'm curious to see how long CP+B can continue to beat this brand before it fizzles out.</p>
