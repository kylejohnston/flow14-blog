<p>Peculiar anti-drug spot from <a href="http://wk.com/">Wieden + Kennedy</a>. <strike>Read a little of the backstory on their blog.</strike> <em>Edit: they removed the post.</em></p>
<p>As a teenager, I never found anti-drug messages particularly compelling (although I said no to drugs in high school). This seems to follow in that tradition; it's very well made, entertaining, and it gets the message across with a little humor and a bit of 'ick', but I don't have a big emotional reaction/a-ha moment by the end. I'd like to know if the concept was shared with the target audience and how they reacted...</p>
