<p>By now, everybody's heard about (and <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/09/what-advertisin.html">commented</a> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">extensively</a> <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&client=news&ie=UTF-8&oi=spell&as_drrb=q&as_qdr=a&q=microsoft+crispin">on</a>) Microsoft's $300 million campaign to rebrand Windows as a indispensable tool for a billions-strong community of like-minded individualists living a <a href="http://www.lifewithoutwalls.com">life without walls</a>. The good people at <a href="http://cpbgroup.com/">CP+B</a> have set the interwebs <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&client=news&ie=UTF-8&oi=spell&as_drrb=q&as_qdr=a&q=microsoft+crispin">abuzz</a> with criticism and praise for the campaign. Time will tell whether that buzz equals a successful campaign, but if history is any guide, the answer may be staring us in the face.</p>
<p>Fire up your flux capacitor and look back at the June 2008 issue of Fast Companyâ€”the issue with a smirking Alex Bogusky gracing the cover. By the time this issue hit the newsstands, many in the ad world had already heard about CP+B's relationship with Microsoft and all the talk centered around what the campaign would look like. As it turns out, the answer lay in the opening spread of the <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/126/believe-it-or-not-hes-a-pc.html">feature article</a>, pictured here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/126/believe-it-or-not-hes-a-pc.html"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/hesapc1.png" alt="" title="Believe it or not, he\&#039;s a PC" width="630" height="361" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-447" /></a></p>
<p>That headline again? "Believe it or not, he's a PC." Theme theme of the recently-launched campaign? "I'm a PC."</p>
<p>If only we'd know then what we known now...</p>
