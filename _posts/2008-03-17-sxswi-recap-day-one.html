<p>SXSWi 2008 has come and gone. This was my second year attending SXSWi, and I have to say '08 was a lot more fun than '07. Over the next few days I'll summarize the panels I sat in on, the hits and misses, the people I met and any ideas that have stuck with me. I'll add photos to the posts as I have time, but if you can't wait, check out my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/flow14/sets/72157604073074838/">SXSWi set on Flickr</a>.</p>

<h2>Details, details</h2>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/naz.jpg" alt="naz hamid at sxswi 2008" /></p>
<p>I kicked off the day with <a href="http://www.nzrn.com/">Naz Hamid's</a> panel, <strong><a href="http://nzrn.com/2008/03/18/post-presentation-wrap-up-slides-etc">Design is in the Details</a></strong> <a href="http://audio.sxsw.com/podcast/interactive/panels/2008/SXSW08.INT.2008.0308.DesignInTheDetails.mp3"><em>(audio)</em></a>. Naz started by offering examples from a range of creative disciplines, including industrial design and cooking:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.fueledbycoffee.com">Craig Berman's</a> "<a href="http://www.craightonberman.com/projects.html">Pinch</a>". It's simple, functional, stylish and speaks to people who love to be in the kitchen.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rapha.cc/index.php?page=354">The Rapha bike jacket</a> is perfectly crafted for its audience; an offset zipper helps to avoid chafing and annoying rattling, a butt flap protects against splashes and features reflective fabric for safety. This jacket perfect example of form following function.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, Naz walked through a checklist he uses to help achieve complete, detailed and functional designs (<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/designisinthedetails">read more on ALA</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) Experiment / Exploration - Don't limit yourself, Explore all the threads, mashup your ideas â€” you never know when you'll find the beautiful mistake.</p>
<p>(2) Choices - Can you defend your design choices or is it just decoration?</p>
<p>(3) Stay Consistent - Make sure your designs are cohesive.</p>
<p>(4) Completeness - Don't skip the small stuff. You don't want your clients/audience to find mistakes or missing and incomplete elements.</p>
<p>(5) Step In, Step Out, Step Back - Step away from your designs. Let the ideas percolate. When you come back, take notes on what stands out (good or bad)</p>
<p>(6) Be Your Own Critic - Take the time (event if it's overtime) to fix anything you know is wrong or incomplete. (see #4).</p>
<p>(7) Complexity in Simplicity - Less is more says it all.</p>
<p>(8) Obsession is Healthy - If you find yourself thinking about your designs in the shower, you're obsessed. Don't fight it. Let the ideas percolate in your mind.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The worst of the worst</h2>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/suxorz.jpg" alt="The Suxorz at SXSWi 2008" /></p>
<p>Next up, <strong>The Suxorz: The Worst Ten Social Media Ad Campaigns of 2007</strong> <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/blogs/podcasts.php/2008/03/11/worst_social_media"><em>(audio)</em></a>, where I met up with a couple of the guys from <a href="http://campfiremedia.com">Campfire</a> to laugh at and learn from the mistakes of companies who have royally screwed up their forays into social media.</p>
<p>Pulling in ideas from their <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=14910105470">Facebook Group</a>, the panelists each offered their nominees, ranging from <a href="http://www.kayesweetser.com/archives/58">Target Rounders</a> to <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=PYPGmwq_Ncw">Carlton Beer</a> to the winner by popular vote, HP PayPerPost <a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/pay-per-post/the-ugly-face-of-blog-marketing-233291.php">(more info here)</a>.</p>
<p>All in all a fun panel, and a reminder that transparency, genuine interest and participation always trump secretive, shady campaigns (which should be obvious).</p>
<h2>Hurts so good</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com">Michael Lopp</a> and <a href="http://daringfireball.net">John Gruber</a> tag-teamed to explain why <strong>Great Design Hurts</strong>. Lopp (an Apple team lead) explained how Apple designs "presents" for their ideas. For example, OS X is a present wrapped in a present (the Mac) wrapped in a present (their packaging) wrapped in a present (the Apple store).</p>
<p>Lopp described his team's design approach "10 to 3 to 1"; for a given feature, they create 10 pixel-perfect mockups. (the pixel-perfection removes the possibility of ambiguity, echoing Naz's "Details" from earlier in the day). From the 10 original ideas, they iterate to 3 mockups, which are further iterated to reach the final design. For a relevant (and over the top) example, see Cultured Code's <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/blog/2008/02/habemus-dialogum-we-have-a-dialog.html">dialog box design</a> for <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>.</p>
<p>Gruber rounded out the last half of the session. I'm a fan of his writing and I enjoyed his panel last year, but I felt like he rambled a bit. FWIW, two random points I walked away with were: (1) Different necessarily implies better, but different is scary and (2) a quote from Paul Rand, "Don't try to be original, just try to be good".</p>
<h2>Droppin' Science</h2>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/coudal.jpg" alt="Jim Coudal at SXSWi 2008" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.coudal.com">Jim Coudal</a> wrapped up the day with my favorite panel, <strong>A General Theory of Creative Relativity</strong> <a href="http://audio.sxsw.com/podcast/interactive/panels/2008/SWSW08.INT.20080308.CreativeRelativity.mp3"><em>(audio)</em></a>. He started with the boilerplate about <a href="http://www.coudal.com">Coudal Partners</a>, leading up to an office creative exercise called "Booking Bands"; the goal is to combine a band name with a book title (i.e. <em>Charlie Daniels and the Chocolate Factory</em>, <em>Megadeath of a Salesman, etc.</em>)</p>
<p>He pointed out that anyone who tries this exercise will either: lock in on a band name and cycle through book titles of vice-versa. Thus, you have a variable and a constant. The resulting association is the creative event, and the first part of the equation.</p>
<p>He screened a great short film, <a href="http://www.coudal.com/regrets.php">"Regrets"</a>, which led into the second part of the theory; the power, the divine spark of energy, the juice, the rush of enthusiasm; when you hit on a million-dollar idea and you can't wait to work on it.</p>
<p>The third part of the the theory is the "Like<sup>3</sup>":</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Like<sup>1</sup></strong> is metaphor. <em>This is like...</em></p>
<p><strong>Like<sup>2</sup></strong> is a summary or shorthand; meaning you could go into an extended explanation of a scenario, or you could, like, summarize... <em>like, duh</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Like<sup>3</sup></strong>: Aesthetic Judgetment; <em>I like...</em></p></blockquote>
<p>All of the above results in an equation; something like: (x+y)E / Like<sup>3</sup>. Where do you go with that? Let me know if you figure it out...</p>
