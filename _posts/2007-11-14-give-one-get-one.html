<p>The more I <a href="http://chrisbrogan.com/400-bucks-can-change-the-world/">read about</a> the <a href="http://www.laptopgiving.org/en/give-one-get-one.php">Give one, get one</a> program, the more I like it. Recently discovered tidbits: $200 tax break and free T-Mobile hotspots for 1 year (for <em>any</em> of your Wi-Fi friendly devices). Plus there's the whole helping people in developing nations aspect. The deal's only available until November 26th... sooo tempting.</p>
