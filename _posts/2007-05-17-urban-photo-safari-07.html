<p>Grab your camera and mark your calendar.... the 2007 <a href="http://www.urbanphotosafari.com/">Urban Photo Safari</a> is officially set for Saturday, June 9th. It's moving to <a href="http://www.lawrence.com/">Lawrence</a> this year.</p>
<p>Until the official site is up and running again, you can see photos from past Safaris <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/39849631@N00/">here</a>.</p>
<p>It's a free event, so if you're looking for an excuse to get creative with a camera, there's nothing quite like it.</p>
