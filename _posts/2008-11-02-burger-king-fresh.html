<p>Burger King and <a href="http://www.messmarketing.net/">Mess Marketing</a> recently opened an Art Gallery/Event Space/Think Tank/Hipster artist collective in Chicago dubbed <a href="http://www.burgerkingstudio.com">Burger King Studio</a>. The concept is kind of interesting; you can mingle with artists at the occasional event and buy and customize t-shirts on the site. All-in-all, a great fit for BK's well-known "have it your way" brand position, but there are some pieces of this campaign that have drawn a little too much inspiration from the creative community they're aping.</p>
<h3>Figure 1 - Inspiration?</h3>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/hmmm.jpg" alt="" title="Burger King Studio compared to Threadless" width="630" height="240" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-539" /></p>
<p>This is a shot <a href="https://www.burgerkingstudio.com/store/">Burger King Studio's Store</a> side-by-side with <a href="http://www.threadless.com">Threadless.com</a> &#8212; note the similarities in the presentation of the t-shirts, the use of hipster models and solicitations to participate/create your own shirts. Despite the similarities, I could give BK a pass on this one as more of an "inspired by" than a rip-off.</p>
<h3>Figure 2 - Rrrrrrrip</h3>

<p>Unlike the Figure 1, this example is a 100% rip-off of a classic design created by <a href="http://www.experimentaljetset.nl/">Experimental Jetset</a>. In fact, this design has been ripped so many times that Experimental Jetset has a <a href="http://www.experimentaljetset.nl/archive/tshirtism_intro.html">section of their site</a> dedicated to cataloging the infractions.</p>
<p>Not only is the t-shirt unoriginal, it kind of made me think of the old McDonalds Big Mac jingle. You know, the one where they sing the ingredients...</p>
<h3>Figure 3 - mixed messages</h3>
<p><em>The jingle is about 15 seconds in...</em></p>
<div class="column span-8 last prepend-4 append-4"><object width="310" height="251"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/bCH7Mo7AjF0&hl=en&fs=1#t=0m15s" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/bCH7Mo7AjF0&hl=en&fs=1#t=0m15s" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="310" height="251"></embed></object></div>

<p>What do you think? Should they get an "A" for going through the effort of trying something new in a well-trod space or is this simply another clumsy corporate co-opting of creative culture?</p>
