<p>Thanks to an email blast courtesy of the Beastie Boys, I tuned into Late Night with Jimmy Fallon last week—they did an amazing rendition of So What'cha Want backed up by The Roots. Check it out about 19:35 into <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/74545/late-night-with-jimmy-fallon-mon-may-25-2009">this episode</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to tune in again Friday night, and was treated to—dare I say—an even better performance. Here's the setup: Fallon asks members of the audience for a few details of their lives, then challenges The Roots crew to freestyle a song on the spot. Even better, they have to match a specific style or genre of music. It's incredible to hear what they come up with in a pinch. The clip below is about 10 minutes, and you're in for a treat if you have time to watch the whole thing. <em>Hint: The Roots channeling Paul Simon.</em></p>
<p>I have to say, this show is really growing on me.</p>
