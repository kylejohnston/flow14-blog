<p><a href="http://mobile.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Mobile 3.0</a> hit the streets today. I used the previous version quite a bit when I first got my BlackBerry... it was handy (and quite fetching), but an annoying update process and too little substance persuaded me to drop it in favor of Google's more spartan <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/">mobile offerings</a>. I'm looking forward to giving Yahoo another go (no pun intended).</p>
