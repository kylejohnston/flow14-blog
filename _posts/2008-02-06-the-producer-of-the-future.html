<p><a href="http://creativity-online.com/">Creativity Online</a> has posted a nice <a href="http://creativity-online.com/work/view?seed=yPlU2kVQ">video tour</a> of CP+B's Boulder office. Normally, I would have posted this as a link dump kind of post, but the first half of the video is interesting enough to warrant a post of its own.</p>
<p>The folks at CP+B are talking integrated producers &mdash; meaning they pair specialists in web, video and interactive on projects. As they work together, those specialists push projects to new places with the added benefit of learning new skills along the way. As they begin to see projects from different perspectives, you end up with a video producer who could excel at creating (or overseeing the creation of) a website, web pros shooting videos for online spots, etc.</p>
<p>This kind of idea has been knocking around in my head for the past year or so, but this video does a great job of putting the disparate ideas in my head down on pixels. I think this approach is a natural evolution of online media and those who create it.</p>
