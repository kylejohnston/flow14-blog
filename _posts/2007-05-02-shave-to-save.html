<p>Kudos to <a href="http://www.designtribune.com">Dean</a> who <em>volunteered</em> to go bald today. Did he do it for fashion or fame? Nope, he did it for the <a href="http://www.cancer.org/">American Cancer Society's</a> 2007 Shave to Save event.</p>
<p>As one of the few people at work with a dreamy 'doo, Dean was on a short list of candidates. We're all glad he was willing to go under the shears in memory of his Dad and in honor of our good friend Scott Bosworth, who made it to the event in just enough time to step up on stage and take the first swipe: </p>
