<p>The fine folks at the <a href="http://barbariangroup.com">Barbarian Group</a> just launched another "why didn't I think of that" site &#8212; <a href="http://www.InternetOnlineWebsite.com">InternetOnlineWebsite.com</a>, a really clever promotion for Aquent (purveyors of contract creatives). You can click on each section of the page to learn more about the skills and people needed to get a modern website up running (as illustrated by the animated GIF below). And to top it all off, if you visit the website (and act fast), you can get a free t-shirt (and probably a lifetime supply of calls and mail from Aquent). You can <a href="http://barbariangroup.com/posts/4951-internetonlinewebsite_com">read more about the site on the Barbarian Groups blog </a>.</p>
