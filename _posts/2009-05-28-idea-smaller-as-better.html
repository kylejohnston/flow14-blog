<p>A line in <a href="http://socialnerdia.com/index.php/2009/05/interview-alex-bogusky-cpb/">this interview with Alex Bogusky</a> caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I'm always surprised by how wealthy people gravitate to huge homes. Who wants to walk a half block to get a midnight snack? But smaller alone isn't really the whole story. Smaller and higher quality is really the opportunity.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is something I often think about when I drive by high-end homes... outside of major cities, it seems like bigger is the only option available for non-retirees. What if builders offered <em>smaller</em> homes with better features?</p>
<p>Offerings I can think of off the top of my head:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher-quality building materials</li>
<li>Pre-configured wireless network (with or without tech support)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/business/15novel.html">Home wind turbines</a> and solar systems</li>
<li>Include a car, maybe a Hybrid in an exclusive model or color</li>
<li>Include bikes, Segways, or other low-impact modes of transportation for quick errands near the neighborhood</li>
<li>Neighborhood services like chefs, nutritionists, personal trainers or pet sitters</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, I think the offerings would need to appeal to self-interest and sense of status to be successful. Green features and community enhancement sound good on a list, but my cynical side isn't sure they would translate into big business.</p>
<p>What do you think—is there an opportunity here?</p>
<ul></ul>
<p><em>This has been the second in a <a href="http://www.flow14.com/blog/category/ideas/">series of random product/service/whatever ideas</a> that pop into my head... ideas that I think are viable from a business and/or usage standpoint, but probably don’t have the time/desire/resources to implement.</em></p>
