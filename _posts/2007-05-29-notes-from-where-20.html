<p>The first hour of where has been interesting; Google announced today's launch of StreetView: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/26lxra">see it in action</a>. During the presentation, John Hanke from Google ran through a couple of really remarkable examples of the power of Street View, including finding parking in San Fran. He zoomed in on the parking lot, zoomed in on the sign at the the entrance to the parking lot and was close enough to read that the parking lot was open to the public... there's incredible potential here.</p>
<p><a href="http://georss.org/">GeoRSS</a> was mentioned in every presentation. Tagging has been a big topic, particularly how to open up tagging users and maintain clean, usable data.</p>
<p>The break's ending... more news, thoughts, and notes to come.</p>
