<p>I ran across <a href="http://wk.typepad.com/weblog/2008/09/music-reborn-or-artists---a-paine-in-the-ass.html">this post</a> in Google Reader and I was about to re-share it, but I think the link warrants its own post...</p>
<p>The basic premise revolves around ad/creative/media agencies adapting to the changing landscape of communication (most unsuccessfully). I've seen a lot of these types of posts recently (either due to New Year's resolutions or the economy), but this particular post really stood out to me.</p>
<p>Basically, I think you can take two approaches to radical shifts in the way the world works: think/discuss/worry about it or jump right in&#8212;just try <em>something</em>, learn what does and doesn't work and go from there.</p>
<h3>Wait for it...</h3>
<p>With the wait and see approach, you probably won't fail (immediately); you continue doing what you've done so well, maybe jump in when the time is right and if your timing is good, you'll continue doing well. On the flip-side, you could jump in too late (or not at all) and when the balance shifts, you'll be left in the dust.</p>
<h3>Just Do It</h3>
<p>With the latter, jump right it approach, the odds are you're more likely to fail than succeed, but you're likely to learn a lot more in the process. Your assumptions will change. You'll have a clearer picture of what your audience <em>actually</em> wants. You could make money offering consulting services to the Waiters : )</p>
<p>In the projects I've been involved in recently, I've been better served by diving in&#8212;I tend to procrastinate, so  the time I normally spend thinking about what I need to do (aka putting it off) is better spent just working on the problem and iterating as needed.</p>
<p>Which camp are you in?</p>
