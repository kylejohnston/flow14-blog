<p><a href="http://www.cahanassociates.com/">Cahan and Associates</a> have gone <em>really</em> minimal with their homepage &#8211; a low-visibility email link and a brief video of the founder talking about the kind of clients they want and the work they want to do (adventurous and extraordinary, respectively). And although you can't see it on their website anymore, their work backs up the bravado.</p>
<p>But you <em>know</em> it's aching for a parody. Enter YouTube:</p>

<p>Who you gonna call?</p>
