<p>Today was the last day of <a href="http://www.sxsw.com">SXSW</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/flow14/417641662/">Dean</a> and I had enough time to squeeze in a session and a half this morning before we had to ditch and catch the plane.</p>
<p>I sat in on <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&id=IAP060136">Customer Service is the New Marketing</a>, a great session on how companies like <a href="http://www.zappos.com">Zappos</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> are going above and beyond to delight their customers. Great stuff that I hope to bring back to <a href="http://www.garmin.com">work</a>. I got a chance to say hi to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32373682187@N01/">Heather</a> from Flickr. Met Steven &mdash; who's the Director of Product Management at <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> &mdash; and let him know what I think of the company (all good stuff). I also ran into (and heaped some praise on) <a href="http://www.carsonsystems.com/">Ryan Carson</a>, creator of <a href="http://www.dropsend.com">DropSend</a>, my favorite little email app for big packages.</p>
<p><a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&id=IAP060141">Design Aesthetic of the Indie Developer</a> was the last session of the day. I met <a href="http://www.bearskinrug.co.uk">Kevin Cornell</a> and (I think) I had my eardrum blown out by <a href="http://danielmall.com/">Dan Mall</a>, who was showing his love for <a href="http://www.shauninman.com/">Inman</a>.</p>
<p>All in all a good day, slightly offset by our unexpected 6 hour stay in the Austin airport. A big ol' storm in Texas put the breaks on all the flights in Dallas. We were supposed to land in KC around 5 &mdash; we hit the runway around 10:30. It's good to be home.</p>
