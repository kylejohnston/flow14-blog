<p>So <a href="http://www.wk12.com">Wieden+Kennedy's</a> Portland office runs a very cool experimental ad school called WK12. Embracing Dan Wieden's credo "You're only good to me after you've made three tremendous mistakes", the 12 gathered 150,000 push pins, what looks like a 10' wall, and a little free time to deliver their message to the world, "Fail Harder".</p>
<p>That looks like the kind of project, after about an hour into it, you wish you hadn't started. Way cool.</p>
