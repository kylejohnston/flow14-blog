<p>Back in April, Haggar Menswear &#8211; a brand on its last legs &#8211; <a href="http://www.haggar.com/gs/n_4.html">announced a unique partnership</a> with the ubiquitous Crispin, Porter + Bogusky. Their mission? Return Haggar to its former glory. That partnership is beginning to bear fruit in the form of <a href="http://www.haggar.com/gs/ads.html">these long form (online-only) spots, print ads and outdoor</a>.</p>
<p>It's good stuff; it will be interesting to see if they can pull off the brand reanimation.</p>
