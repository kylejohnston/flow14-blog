<p>Much to my consternation, WordPress and YouTube <em>do not</em> play nice togther. A quick <a href="http://www.blingo.com/search?q=wordpress+youtube&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">Blingo</a> search reveals this is a common frustration.</p>
<p>There are several plugins available which presumably solve this issue, but I've had a lot of coffee tonight and I'm can't sit still long enough to install a plugin. So with a with a <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/53570">few tips</a> from the WP community and a little trial-and-error, I think I've figured out a no-plugin solution.</p>
<p>First and foremost, shut down the visual rich editor. If you are the sole author and admin, go to Users > and uncheck "Use the visual rich editor when writing". If you have additional users, you will need to uncheck the same checkbox under Options > Writing. "WordPress should correct invalidly nested XHTML automatically" should also be unchecked.</p>
<p>Finally, there should be <em>no</em> line breaks in the YouTube URL, something WordPress has a tendency to add automagically.</p>
<p>That's the trick. If you're a fellow 'Presser, give it a shot and let me know if it works for you.</p>
