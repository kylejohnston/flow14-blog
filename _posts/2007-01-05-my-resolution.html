<p>Don't write any new posts over the holidays. Done and done.</p>
<p>The regular reader of this blog may have noticed a downshift in posts. I took a refreshing little holiday break and I'm ready to get back to business, and I'm back with a posse. Well, one guest author; my friend, fellow designer, and <a href="http://urbanphotosafari.com/">safari organizer</a>, Dean Olufson. Dean plans to pontificate on all manner of things related to design and creativity.</p>
<p>Be sure to check out his <a href="http://www.flow14.com/blog/2006/12/19/remember-quicktime-vr/">first post</a> &#8211; a look back at an olde tyme digital photography technique, Quicktime VR.</p>
