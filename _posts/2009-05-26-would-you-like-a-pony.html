<p>On a totally unrelated note, this blog has been woefully neglected over the past few months in favor of—in no particular order—getting <a href="http://www.creative-cohort/">Creative Cohort</a> off the ground, a couple of extensive freelance projects, gobs of activity at the regular gig and livin' life. More posts to follow soon, probably a short burst of activity followed by another month or two of dead silence. Such is life.</p>
