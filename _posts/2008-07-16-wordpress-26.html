<p>I just finished an uneventful upgrade to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress 2.6</a>. I was a little nervous as I'd heard some <a href="http://www.chrisbrogan.com/quick-note-wordpress-26-beware/">bad things</a> about this version, but the whole process was as smooth as silk for me. It's a nice update, so I'll probably upgrade a few of the other sites I manage over the weekend.</p>
<p>In semi-related news, I'm putting the finishing touches on a new site design, which gives me an excuse to test 2.6's media mananger.... stay tuned.</p>
