<p>Do you owe me a beer? Now you have a convenient way to let me know: <a href="http://foamee.com/">Foamee</a> harnesses the power of <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> to keep track of the best kind of promises... those that involve alcohol. Just message @ioubeer @flow14 for a good review (or some other reason), and I'll be forever in your debt (or until I'm done with the beer, whichever comes first).</p>
