<p>If you hadn't already heard, Conan O'Brien recently left the spot he's been holding down since '93 and <a href="http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/">Jimmy Fallon</a> took his place (or time slot at least).</p>
<p>I probably wouldn't have been inclined checked out the new show, but Mr. Fallon managed to secure <a href="http://www.theroots.com/">The Legendary Roots Crew</a> as his house band. After watching a few minutes of the show, I started to doubt they could be used to their full effect. Then, they started to slow jam the news. Faith = restored.</p>
