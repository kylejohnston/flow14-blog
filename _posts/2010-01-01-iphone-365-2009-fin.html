<p>I participated in an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/iphone365/">iPhone365</a> project in the 2009. It was much more difficult that I thought it would be. Even with a cameraphone by my side at all times, there were days I forgot to take a picture, days where I wasn't inspired to take a picture (those days: Wake up, go to work, come home, repeat = yawn) and towards the end of the year, I just didn't get around to taking any photos.</p>
<p>When all was said and done (yesterday), I came out with 198 photos -- an admirable effort, but well short of the goal. It's still a blast to look through the photos and see where I was (or where my head was) throughout the year.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I made a quick movie of all the photos set to the song I listened to the most in 2009, Radiohead's "Gagging Order" (199 plays, according to iTunes). Enjoy!</p>
<p>(and if you want to participate in 2010, it's the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/iphone365/">perfect time to start</a>. I've already <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/flow14/4234582493/">posted my first photo</a> for 2010. </p>
