<p>Here's some of the stuff that's caught my eye recently that may be worth your time, too:</p>
<p><a href="http://creativity-online.com/?action=news:article&newsId=131037&sectionName=feature">The Price is Right (Isn't It?)</a> Why shouldn't made-for-web productions should have budget as big as their televised counterparts? This article aims to lay the groundwork putting a fair price on your digital blood, sweat and tears.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.springwise.com/">Springwise</a> - This is a recent addition to the <em>Review</em> category in my RSS feed. Basically, it's a steady stream of new business ideas&#8212;some new interesting, some stuff that's been in the market for a while. Kind of a <a href="http://www.trendhunter.com/">Trend Hunter</a> with a business focus. Worth a look.</p>
<p><a href="dev.mobi">dev.mobi</a> recently relaunched as  <a href="http://mobiforge.com/">mobiForge</a>. I hadn't really spent a lot of time exploring this site before the refresh; there's a <em>ton</em> of content available. They have resources for developers, designers, marketers and more.  It looks like a great resource for anyone who's involved in the mobile space.</p>
<p>And if your mindset is more design thinking/trend hunting/cool data, mobiForge has a sister site, <a href="http://mobithinking.com/">mobiThinking</a>. The content's not as deep as the main site, but it's worth an add to the 'ol feedreader.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.brosbeforeblogs.com/2008/09/social-revolt.html ">Wecome to the social (media) revolt</a> - the gist: by its very nature, the web is in a constant state of change and its always been about making connections, so why is social media seen as a new, groundbreaking idea?</p>
<p>I have to agree with Joshua's angle; the fundamentals haven't changed, but the tools we all use to connect/socialize/etc. are getting easier and easier for non-geeks to use, which allows more people to participate and brings the "social" bit of social media to the fore.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://barackobamaisyournewbicycle.com/">simple idea</a> that provided hours of entertainment this summer is popping up again: <a href="http://www.johnmccainisyourjalopy.com/">John McCain Is Your Jalopy</a> and <a href="http://palin.appspot.com/">Sarah Palin Is Your New Bicycle's Flat Tire</a>. I think the web will be a little less entertaining once the elections are over.</p>
