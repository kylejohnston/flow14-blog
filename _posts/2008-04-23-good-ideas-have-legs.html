<p>Since discovering <a href="http://www.barbariangroup.com/posts">the barbarian group's</a> website a scant <a href="http://www.flow14.com/blog/2008/04/20/links-o8217-the-week/">four days ago</a>, I've become completely hooked. As my feed reader inches closer to 500 unread items and my attention span dwindles accordingly, I cringe at their rapid succession of long form posts (4 of 'em so far today). However, each time I've taken the time to actually read the full posts, I've been rewarded by well-crafted ideas and a little rush of inspiration. </p>
<p>One today's posts really hit home:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.barbariangroup.com/posts/253-agnosticism_media_and_otherwise">Agnosticism, media and otherwise</a> touches on a subject that has been raised many, many times in my office the past few weeks. Quoting:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;... agnostic ideas, ideas that solve client’s problems without filtering them against a pre-set media vehicle or creative skill set [...] sometimes that’s a television ad, sometimes a website, sometimes an LED display on a blimp, sometimes all three. But, <strong>who the hell knows ahead of time?</strong>&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The gist (to me) being: don't cut the legs off your ideas by defaulting to traditional/tested/comfortable forms of communication &#8212; if an idea is good, it will shine <em>anywhere</em>.</p>
