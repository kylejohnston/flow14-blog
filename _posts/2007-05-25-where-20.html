<p>I'm heading out for <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/where2007/">Where 2.0</a> later this weekend (which includes tacking on a couple days of vaca in San Fran).</p>
<p>Should be an interesting conference with folks from all over online mapping world in attendance; Google, Yahoo, MapQuest, <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Mapping</a>, <a href="http://www.garmin.com">my gang</a>, and many others.</p>
<p>Monday evening's <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/where2007/view/e_sess/12351">Ignite Where</a> session sounds like an interesting way to kick off the conference&mdash;20 speakers get 5 minutes on stage with 15 seconds per slide to say whatever they want. I definitely want to check it out if we make it to San Jose on time... depends on how long we spend cruising down the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Coast_Highway_%28United_States%29">PCH</a>.</p>
<p>* update: found more details about the Ignite session on <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/186465/">Upcoming.org</a> *</p>
<p>** update 2: found <a href="http://ignitenight.blip.tv/">video</a> from an Ignite event in Seattle ** </p>
