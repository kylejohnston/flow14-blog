<p>I watched a few minutes of Adult Swim tonight and I was exposed to a whole crop of new (to me) commercials.</p>
<p>Given the political season and an inability to distract myself from the up-and-downs of the day-to-day drama, this spot easily caught my eye. After checking out each candidate's site (<a href="http://www.kitten08.org">kitten</a>, <a href="http://www.babyforpresident.com/">baby</a>) â€” I still have no idea what's in store, but I'll probably check it out on October 21st. It's hard to top the absurdity of real-life politics, but it looks like they might come close.</p>
