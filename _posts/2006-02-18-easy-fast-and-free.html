<p>I needed to send a 50Mb file to a vendor recently. In the past, the lowest-hassle (but slowest) solution was to burn a disc and drop it in the mail. I've heard of services that allow you to email large files online, so it seemed like the perfect time to try <a href="http://www.dropsend.com/">DropSend</a>. I'm a believer. It's simple &#8211; I had an account set up in less than a minute. It's fast &#8211; I uploaded a 50Mb file in a little over a minute. I was automatically notified when the vendor downloaded the file. Best of all, it didn't cost me a dime (although I'd happily pay for the service). Did I mention the free gifts?</p>
<p>DropSend offers different <a href="http://dropsend.com/pricingsignup.php">levels of pricing</a> for their service, from free to $19 for power users. </p>
<p>If you need to send or store large files online, <a href="http://www.dropsend.com/">this</a> is the place.</p>
